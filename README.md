# MyBank Console Application in TypeScript

This project is a TypeScript implementation of a MyBank Console Application, originally demonstrated in C#. The project aims to showcase the principles of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) using TypeScript. By translating C# code into TypeScript, this project helps developers understand and apply OOP concepts such as classes, inheritance, encapsulation, and polymorphism in a TypeScript environment.

## Features

- **Account Management**: Create and manage different types of bank accounts.
- **Transactions**: Handle deposits, withdrawals, and transfers between accounts.
- **Account Statements**: Generate and view account statements with transaction history.
- **Interest Calculation**: Implement interest calculation for savings accounts.
- **Error Handling**: Manage common banking errors and invalid operations.

## Objectives

- Learn and apply Object-Oriented Programming concepts in TypeScript.
- Understand the similarities and differences between C# and TypeScript.
- Gain practical experience in writing and organizing TypeScript code.
- Develop a console application that simulates a basic banking system.

## Technologies Used

- TypeScript
- Node.js (for running the console application)
- Inquirer (for user input in the console)

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the repository**: 
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/MyBank-Console-App-TypeScript.git
   ```
2. **Install dependencies**: 
   ```sh
   npm install
   ```
3. **Run the application**: 
   ```sh
   npm start
   ```

## Project Structure

- **src**: Contains the main TypeScript source files.
  - **models**: Contains classes for bank accounts and transactions.
  - **services**: Contains services for managing accounts and transactions.
  - **utils**: Utility functions and helpers.
  - **index.ts**: Entry point of the application.

## Learning Outcomes

- Develop a solid understanding of OOP principles in TypeScript.
- Learn to design and implement classes and interfaces in TypeScript.
- Gain experience with TypeScript's type system and how it compares to C#.
- Build a functional console application using TypeScript.
